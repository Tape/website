title: Final Fantasy Type-0 HD Review
---

A handheld game ported to consoles and remastered. What could go wrong?

---

## Combat

For being originally made for a handheld missing some buttons and a joystick, the game feels surprisingly functional for
a Final Fantasy game of the era it came out in. Having a dodge mechanic and abilities without menu scrolling is always a
great addition.

In the negative department, you can usually just alternate attack and dodge and basically be invincible. Not bad for the
casual gamer, but not particularly exciting gameplay for those seeking even a mild challenge. The only real challenge
presented in the game is an option to have monsters severely outlevel you.

## Story

The core story is pretty interesting until you meet the initial goal from the intro, and then afterward I cannot even
comprehend what the hell even happened. It reminds me of Kingdom Hearts where things start off as relatively digestible
as bizarre as it may be, then suddenly go full anime.

## Progression

I don't even really know what to say here. There is none. Sure, the game has a level-up system that lets you gain new
skills, but the actual progression _through_ the game is awful. You complete missions which then give you the ability to
kill time waiting for the next mission, but the side content is just not fun. The missions already drained any sense of
adventure I had. The optional missions are more of the same, and the dialogue you can share with other NPCs is so dry
and not interesting.

## Conclusion

I can't recommend this game. It's fairly short and straightforward which is uncommon for the Final Fantasy universe, and
everything is fairly boring or confusing. 3/10.
