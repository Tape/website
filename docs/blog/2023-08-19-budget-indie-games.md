In this blog I go over a few indie games that I have played recently that I have spent no more than $5 on. They've
provided me some entertainment and felt like writing about my experiences with them each briefly.

## Gris

Gris is an exploration platformer. You begin as somebody who has clearly lost all of their powers and the world is
missing color. You start off the game slowly hobbling around and build up to being able to sing plants to life. The game
is extremely easy, but the art is great and the soundtrack is relatively decent. I give it a 7/10.

## The Suicide of Rachel Foster

This game is an exploration suspense title which tells the story of a family separated by infidelity, but still haunts
them to this day. You begin as the daughter of a recently deceased man, who had a secret relationship with Rachel
Foster, who killed herself by jumping off a cliff. There's a lot of sensitive themes in this game and many reviewers
seem to feel the game developers skirt around some of these, but I don't think having to acknowledge them at every turn
is how these situations would work out in the real world. Regardless, a great game deserving of a 7/10.

## Tchia

Tchia is a surprisingly polished game that is a love letter to New Caledonia. It tells the story of a little girl who is
basically investigating the disappearance of her family, which takes place using Wind Waker style exploration and
combat. There's plenty to see even though the world is relatively bare, but quite detailed for the small studio that
developed it. Giving this a 6/10 mainly due to limited amount of fast travel.

## Wales Interactive FMVs

I've played a bunch of FMV games by Wales lately. I have to say, they don't have the highest production quality or
acting by any means, but they do a decent job of presenting a mildly interactive movie experience and some of them end
up being fairly enjoyable. Late Shift, The Bunker, The Complex, and She Sees Red are among the ones I have tried, and
they're all enjoyable for their own reasons. A blanket 6/10 for these titles.

## Toem

I can't say enough good things about this game. The art is great, the humor is excellent. You are tasked with exploring
the world outside your small town and climb the mountain to view the "Toem". I don't really want to say too much more,
but this is easily one of my favorite puzzle games. This game gets a solid 8/10 from me.
