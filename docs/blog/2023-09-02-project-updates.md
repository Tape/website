title: Project Updates
---

I don't really have much to talk about this week, so I figured it's a good time to review what I have done with my
personal projects and provide updates on them.

---

## Website

I've managed to keep up weekly blogs about completely random and unplanned topics. At some point I think I can take on
updates on the project pages with more of these details. At this time though, I think I'm good with an update here and
save updates there for when I can actually provide a prototype or hosted page that can be played around with. I also
set up the GitHub actions to auto deploy every time I push up new content, so that's nice.

## FFXIV Tools

Nothing really notable here, although I have added some CI functionality and plan to add more in the future. I think it
would be nice to begin to add some new functionality here or at the very least experiment with some new technology, but
for now I'm good with it as it is.

## OpenPSN

This so far as been more or less a sandbox to learn about how to handle a Java monorepo and experiment with how I'd like
to scale up the project. As of right now I'm fairly well solidified on a web framework (Svelte/SvelteKit) and backend
(Jooby, PostgreSQL) with a working set of tools to connect to the PlayStation API. It's just a matter of tying all of
that together with authentication, pulling data, and building a nice UI/UX.

## Peloton WebApp

This is a new project that I've been fiddling around with to learn more about Svelte/SvelteKit. It takes an exported
workout CSV from the Peloton workout screen and aggregates and eventually charts the data. I'm thinking of making it
more as a motivational tool for the time being, but maybe scope can increase later.

## Game

I still have a life goal to complete and publish a game at some point. Problem is, there are a lot of skills that need
to be developed in order to make that happen as well as an idea I truly believe in, so until we get to that point this
is just a thought experiment. I'm a fan of idle games and simple 2d concepts, so maybe I can work on one, the other, or
maybe both combined at some point!
