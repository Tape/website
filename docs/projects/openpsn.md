OpenPSN is an attempt to try and open source and crowdfund something typically managed by for-profit companies. This
site will attempt to set up a means by which to allow anyone to contribute to adding functionality. See the project
README for current goals and technologies, but since this is simply in the infancy stages not much has been built out at
this time.
