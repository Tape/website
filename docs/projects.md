Basically a blog and a portfolio for myself. I am mostly using out of the box functionality here but there is some
functionality that I extended myself, such as adding a blog. This uses dynamic data generated at build time to allow me
to dynamically generate pages but statically generate them for a seamless deployment.

FFXIV Tools is a project I set up for myself and my friends that pulls items and recipes from the
[Universalis](https://universalis.app/) API to maximize profitability. Everyone had their own goals, but I wanted to be
able to afford an in-game house for my wife and I. This tool helped make that goal much more achievable. This ultimately
did not help the fact that I suck pretty bad at decorating houses.

## OpenPSN

Source can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Tape/psn-trophy-site) (monorepo).

OpenPSN is an attempt to try and open source and crowdfund something typically managed by for-profit companies. This
site will attempt to set up a means by which to allow anyone to contribute to adding functionality. See the project
README for current goals and technologies, but since this is simply in the infancy stages not much has been built out at
this time.
