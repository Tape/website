FFXIV Tools is a project I set up for myself and my friends that pulls items and recipes from the
[Universalis](https://universalis.app/) API to maximize profitability. Everyone had their own goals, but I wanted to be
able to afford an in-game house for my wife and I. This tool helped make that goal much more achievable. This ultimately
did not help the fact that I suck pretty bad at decorating houses.
